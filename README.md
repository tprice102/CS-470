Final Project

This repository will be a walkthrough on my coursework throughout CS-470 at SNHU. I will try to provided brief explanations of each branch in this README to allow ease of navigation and understanding my work.

Module One:
The goal of this module was to prepare my environment for moving a full stack MEAN application into containers. The submissions for this module consist of screenshots showing that I was able to correctly set up Docker to be able to containerize my application.
Grade: 100%

Module Two Assignment One:
In this module, I created containers for both the Angular frontend, MEAN REST API and Mongo DB backend of the application. The submissions consist of the dockerfile and screenshots of the docker images command output, The angular frontend running in the container with the URL on the local host, and the LoopBack explorer frontend running in the container, showing the URL on the local host.
Grade: 100%

Module Two Assignment Two:
In this module, I used docker-compose to create a shared network, a backend and frontend script for containers and then run it. The submissions consisted of the docker-compose YAML files, docker-compose images, LoopBack explorer running with the addition of a new question, Angular frontend running the application showing the aforementioned question, MongoDB showing the question collection and the Docker ps -a (output)
Grade: 100%

Module Three:
The goal of this module was to prepare the Angular application, create the S3 bucket, copy the frontend to S3 file storage, configure the static website, configure S3 public access, and configure the S3 bucket policy. The submissions consist of the static website hosting the shows S3 configured as a server, settings showing the permissions of the bucket with public access allowed, and the S3 bucket showing Angular files. There is also a JSON file with the bucket-policy showing read only, as well as the bucket name URL.
Grade: 100%

Module Four Assignment One:
The goal for this assignment was to create a Lambda and produce a serverless compute function, test the Lambda by creating and naming a test-case, create an echo function by refactoring the lambda, and testing the echo function using a new case with the REST query parameter. The submissions consist of the first serverless compute function, execution results, EchoWithQuery execution results, the created test event "EchoWithQuery", and index.js
Grade: 100%

Module Four Assignment Two:
The goal of this assignment was to create the API method to the Lambdas from the previous assignment and then using the API method test console to test my API. The submissions will consist of the GET method execution page, the GET test page, the browser running the URL, and the invoke URL from my deployment.
Grade: 100%

Module Five Assignment One:
The goal of this assignment was to create DynamoDB tables and create the items and attributes for the table (those being Question and Answer tables). The submission consists of an overview of the Question and Answer tables.
Grade: 91.26%

Module Five Assignment Two:
The goal of this assignment is to create five Lambdas (TableScan, GetSingleRecord, UpsertQuestion, UpsertAnswer, DeleteRecord), create a table-level security policy allowing Lambdas to access the tables, create a Lambda-level security policy attaching each of the Lambdas I have created, and to prove that the Lambdas work against each database for each function. The submissions the following screenshots:
  1) Three test runs for QuestionWithoutFilter, QuestionWithFilter, and AnswerWithoutFilter
  2) Two test runs for TestGetQuestion and TestGetAnswer
  3) The directory structure and index.js file in the Lambda window for UpsertQuestion and UpsertAnswer
  4) Two test runs for TestInsertQuestion and TestInsertAnswer
  5) Two test runs for TestDeleteQuestion and TestDeleteAnswer
  6) The JSON policy
Grade: 100%

Project:
The goals for this assignment were to establish an S3 server to host a static Angular website and migrate all of the server-side business logic to AWS. The submission consists of the API URL/Endpoint and the S3 URL/Endpoint.
